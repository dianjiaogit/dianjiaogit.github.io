<p><strong>Axioms 3.1 (Kolmogorov â€˜s axioms of probability theory)</strong><br />
Let $\Omega$ be the sample space. Events are subsets of $\Omega$.<br />
If A and B are events, then A $\cap$ B, A $\cup$ B, and A \ B are events.<br />
$\Omega$ and {} are events.<br />
There is a function p which assigns nonnegative reals, called proabilities, to each event.<br />
p($\Omega$) = 1, p({}) = 0.<br />
p(A $\cup$ B) = p(A) + p(B) - p(A $\cap$ B).<br />
For a decreasing sequence A1 $\supset$ A2 $\supset$ A3 â€¦ of events with $\bigcap_n$ An = {} we have $\lim_{n \to \infty}$ p(An) = 0.</p>

<p><strong>Definition 3.2 (Conditional probability)</strong><br />
If A and B are events with p(A) &gt; 0, then $p (B | A) := \frac{p (A \cap) B}{p(A)}$</p>

<p>p($\cdot$ | A) is also a probability measure, if p($\cdot$) satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 3.3 (Bayesâ€™ rule 1)</strong><br />
If A and B are events with p(A) &gt; 0 and p(B) &gt; 0, then $p(B | A) = \frac{p(A | B) p(B)}{p(A)}$</p>

<p><strong>Axioms 3.4 (Coxâ€™s (1946) axioms for beliefs)</strong><br />
The degree of belief in event B given that event A occurred: function Bel(B|A).</p>
