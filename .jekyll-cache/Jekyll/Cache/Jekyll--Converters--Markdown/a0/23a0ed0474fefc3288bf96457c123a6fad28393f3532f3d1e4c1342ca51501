<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Starting
2. Targeting
3. Initial Access
4. Persistence, Access Expansion, Exfiltration.
5. Detection
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stage 1: Targeting contains identification of the target network, the attack strategies and tactics necessary to exploit that network.</p>

<p>Stage 2: Initial Access contains of penetrating any defensive security and gaining the ability to run commands or other software on one of the target‚Äôs computers or network devices.</p>

<p>Stage 3 : Persistence turns initial access into reoccurring access.</p>

<p>Stage 4: Expansion increasing access to a target network.</p>

<p>Stage 5: Exfiltration is the retrieval of wanted data from the target network.</p>

<p>Stage 6: Detection occurs when an operation is exposed to the target.</p>

<h1 id="principle-of-access">Principle of Access:</h1>
<p>There is always someone with legitimate access and a means to use it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Four basics types of connectivity:
    <ul>
      <li>inbound access</li>
      <li>outbound access</li>
      <li>both</li>
      <li>neither</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inbound-access">Inbound Access:</h2>
<p>Someone from outside the network can connect into the network. e.g. public web, or restricted.<br />
Access control: ‚Äúknow‚Äù, ‚Äúhave‚Äù and ‚Äúvirtual location‚Äù.</p>

<p>Attacking method:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Impersonating legitimate access<br />
‚Äúknow‚Äù: Guess or steal password<br />
‚Äúhave‚Äù: Steal hardware tokens or cell phones. Use malware.<br />
‚Äúvirtual location‚Äù: Compromise the network first.</li>
  <li>Gaining illegitimate access<br />
Exploit an exposed software service. e.g. Morris Worm<br />
Escalating privileges.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="outbound-access">Outbound Access:</h2>
<p>Someone from inside the network can connect to outside but the network is not accessible from the outside.<br />
So attackers need an inside user to connect to the outside. e.g. e-mail.</p>

<h2 id="email-attacks">Email Attacks</h2>
<p>Three basic approach: attachments, attacking the e-mail program, and malicious links.</p>

<h3 id="attachments">Attachments</h3>
<p>First Generation Attachment: Executable program, install something in the background to grant access to the attacker. Simple, direct and effective.<br />
Second Generation Attachment: Documents that contained the ability to run code. Send a copy to other e-mail addresses in the address book. Because of the ‚Äúmacro‚Äù feature of Microsoft Office.<br />
Third Generation Attachment: Programs that do not seem like programs. Esoteric extensions e.g. .chm or .hta. E-mail filter updated to catch them.<br />
Current Generation Attachment: Third-party application-specific documents, e.g. .doc, .xls, .pdf, .zip‚Ä¶ use vulnerabilities of the application to execute the code.</p>

<h3 id="attacking-the-e-mail-program">Attacking the e-mail program</h3>
<p>Ideal Attack. Send specially crafted e-mail, corrupt the e-mail program, execute attacker-supplied code. Only need the user to preview or view the e-mail. Does not need the user to open the attachment.</p>

<h3 id="malicious-links">Malicious links</h3>
<p>Links bring the user to specifically designed websites to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers or plug-ins.</p>

<h2 id="website-hijack-attacks">Website Hijack Attacks</h2>
<p>Commandeer legitimate sites that the attacker knows or hopes a target user will visit. aka ‚ÄúWatering hole‚Äù attacks. The Attacker waits for the target to come to them. Same result as e-mail link-based attack except it does not need e-mail to direct the user.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Attacker takes over and replaces the content of a popular website with malicious code.</li>
  <li>Use a cross-site-scripting attack (XSS). The Attacker uploads code that the website then displays to other users. These sites allow users to post information or comments.</li>
  <li>Avoid commandeering the website itself, hijack the domain name. Hack the registrars, so the IP address from the DNS server will be different.</li>
  <li>Use ad network instead of commandeering a website. As advertisements can be placed by anyone, including the attacker. Put malicious code into the ads.</li>
  <li>Pornography, illegal software, or pirated movies that are tainted and posted for download. Hope users of the target network will open them.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="other-attacks">Other Attacks</h2>
<p>Malicious thumb drives<br />
Attack other network that the laptops connect to<br />
Wireless access<br />
Attack from smartphones<br />
Social engineering<br />
Physical access attack<br />
‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="circumventing-outbound-restrictions">Circumventing Outbound Restrictions</h2>
<p>How to restrict access:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Software, such as parental control software, Kaspersky and McAffee<br />
Attacker need user to ‚Äúallow‚Äù or attack the software directly.</li>
  <li>Software or hardware on the network, such as firewall or proxy sercer.<br />
Must gain access to the network device itself (but difficult). Or Establish a command and control channel into the network (but need circumventing the device first). Or Establish outbound connections via allowed network protocols (Easier).</li>
</ol>

<p>Attacker‚Äôs challenge: lecerage initial execution to circumvent host-based and network-based restrictions and establish command and control.</p>

<h2 id="bidirectional-access">Bidirectional Access</h2>
<p>Some types of connections are allowed in and others allowed out. Each direction may have its own set of access controls, restictions and monitoring.</p>

<p>The attacker follows the path of least resistance, mixes and matches approaches for the greatest effect.</p>

<h2 id="no-outside-access">No Outside Access</h2>
<p>A network with no outside connectivity is commonly called an isolated network or an ‚Äúair-gapped‚Äù network. This network is physically separated from the Internet.</p>

<p>The most secure network configuration possible to protect against outsider threats and the most inconvenient for sharing information or administering.</p>

<p>Attacker must breach physical security or trick, cajole, bribe, or blakmail users into doing it for them.</p>

<p>Air gap did not prevent the Stuxnet worm.</p>

<p>Attacker must find a way to be, to corrupt, or to compromise an insider in order to reduce the problem of physical access to one of insider threat security.</p>

<p>Ambitions will always exceed available resources. All ambitions are tempered by the constraints of reality.</p>
