# Bayesian Probability Theory  

## Frequency Interpretation: Counting  
Probabilities --> relative frequencies  
The probability of the event E: $\lim_{n \to \infty} k_n (E) / n$  

* Problem:  
	1. Frequency Interpretation is Circular (unlikely occurance) 
	2. Reference Class Problem (No identical similar)  
	3. Limited to I.I.D. (non-i.i.d. data)  

## Objective Interpretation: Uncertain Events  
**Axioms 3.1 (Kolmogorov 's axioms of probability theory)**  
Let $\Omega$ be the sample space. Events are subsets of $\Omega$.  
If A and B are events, then A $\cap$ B, A $\cup$ B, and A \ B are events.  
$\Omega$ and \{\} are events.  
There is a function p which assigns nonnegative reals, called proabilities, to each event.  
p($\Omega$) = 1, p(\{\}) = 0.  
p(A $\cup$ B) = p(A) + p(B) - p(A $\cap$ B).  
For a decreasing sequence A1 $\supset$ A2 $\supset$ A3 ... of events with $\bigcap_n$ An = \{\} we have $\lim_{n \to \infty}$ p(An) = 0.
