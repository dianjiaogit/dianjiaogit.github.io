### Machine Learning includes Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning.


---------------------------------------------------- 
<br />

## Supervised Learning:
	Given a dataset that contains n samples (x1, y1) (x2, y2)...
	Find relation between features and output
	and then do prediction

### Regression VS Classification

Regression: \\
	if y is a continuous variable (eg. price predicion)

Classification: \\
	label is a discrete variable




## Unsupervised Learning:
	Dataset has no labels

### Clustering: 
	Gaussian mixture model, 
	k-means, 
	PCA



### Use for CV:
	Object detection
	Objection localization
	Image Classification

### Use for NLP:
	Machine translation



## Reinforcement Learning:
	Collect data interactively
	Try strategy and collect feedbacks
	Improve the strategy based on the feedbacks

### E.g.:
	AI play video games
	Alpha Go
	MuZero (Dec 2020), Deepmind, more general, play all games. 

Word "Embeddings": \\
	- Represent words by vectors \\
	- Represent relation by direction 

Senticap: \\
	- Describing Images with Sentiments 

SemStyle: \\
	- Learning to Caption from Romantic Novels
