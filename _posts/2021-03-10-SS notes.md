## Hex Editing  
know where to edit, directly edit using hex editor.  
only allows in-place editing. No adding new bytes.  
But can rewrite padding bytes, dead code, or unused data. 

LD_PRELOAD: specify libraries for the linker to load before.  

## Injecting a code section

By appending bytes to the end of the binary.  
Create a section header.  
Create a program header.  
Rename the section name in .shstrtab  
Call the injected code.  

PT_NOTE header saft to overwrite.  
Need to change type to SHT_PROGBITS.  

Injected code will run when the program starts.  

## Hijacking GOT entries  
Replace GOT entry to replace a library call with an injected function.  

Only work for library calls.  
directly modify direct call instructions.  

Position Independent Executables (PIE)
