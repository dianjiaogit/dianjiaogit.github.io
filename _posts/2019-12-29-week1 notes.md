Goal of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): \\
Build general-purpose Super-Intelligences

HOW??? \\
--> Build system by trail & error (Artificial Approach) \\
--> Mimic human behavior (Natural Approach) (Not covered in this course)

So we need THEORIES to guide us.

For Artificial Approach: \\
AI system includes: \\
	- Logic/language based \\
	- Economics inspired \\
	- Cybernetics \\
	- Machine Learning \\
	- Information processing

Intelligence does not have a formal definition yet.

Humanly Thinking: 		Cognitive Science\\
Humanly Acting:			Turing test, Behaviorism\\
Rationally Thinking:	Laws Thought\\
Rationally Acting:		Doing the Right Thing (the topic we discuss)


Decision Theory = Probability + Utility Theory\\
Uncertain world, environmental probability distribution is $\textit{known}$.

Universal Induction = Ockham + Bayes + Turing\\
Sequence prediction for $\textit{unknown}$ prior distribution.

AI = Decision Theory + Universal Induction
