Goal of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): \\
Build general-purpose Super-Intelligences

HOW??? \\
--> Build system by trail & error (Artificial Approach) \\
--> Mimic human behavior (Natural Approach) (Not covered in this course)

So we need THEORIES to guide us.

For Artificial Approach: \\
AI system includes: \\
	- Logic/language based \\
	- Economics inspired \\
	- Cybernetics \\
	- Machine Learning \\
	- Information processing

Intelligence does not have a formal definition yet.
<pre>
Humanly Thinking:		Cognitive Science
Humanly Acting:			Turing test, Behaviorism\\
Rationally Thinking:	Laws Thought\\
Rationally Acting:		Doing the Right Thing (the topic we discuss)

**Decision Theory = Probability + Utility Theory**\\
Uncertain world, environmental probability distribution is *known*.

**Universal Induction = Ockham + Bayes + Turing**\\
Sequence prediction for *unknown* prior distribution.

**AI = Decision Theory + Universal Induction}**

UAI covers all Reinforcement Learning(RL) problem types  
--> Statistical Machine Learning:  
Mostly independent and identically distributed(i.i.d.) data classification, regression, clustering  
--> RL Problems & Algorithms:  
Stochastic, unknown, non-i.i.d. environments  
--> Artificial Intelligence:  
Traditionally deterministic, known world/planning problem  
\\

Informal Definition of Intelligence:  
Intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.  

Induting a model of the environment --> Make predictions --> Make a decision --> Do the next action  

**Induction:**  
Occam's razor: Take simplest hypothesis consistent with data.  

Then how to quantify "simplicity"?  
Description Length!

--> Shortest description of object is best explanation.

Shortest description = Shortest prgram for a string on a Turing Machines T --> Best extrapolation = Prediction  

$$K_T(x) = \min_{p}\{\ell(p) : T(p) = x\}$$

Kolmogorov-complexity$(x) = K(x) = K_U(x) \leq K_T(x) + c_T$
