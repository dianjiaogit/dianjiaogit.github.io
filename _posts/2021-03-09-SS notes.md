## Function Dectection  

Called directly by the $call$ instruction.  
Indirect all is hard to dectect.

## Object-Oriented Code  
We only discuss about C code in this course  

## Structuring Data  
Automatic data struction detection in stripped binaries is a notoriouly difficult problem  
Some codes can be compiled into similar instructions  

## Decompilation  
Guessing function signatures and local variables  
Recovering control flows and function calls  

Intermediate Representation  
- Abstration  
- Goal: translate Machine code to IR code   

# Binary Analysis Properties  
Interprocedural and intraprocedural  
Flow sensitivity  
Context sensitivity  

## Intraprocedural 
Code within a single function at a time  
- Maybe incomplete

## Interprocedural  
Consider entire program as a whole
- Might take long so results no longer matter.  

## Flow Sensitivity  
Take the order of the instructions into account.  
Either flow-sensitive or flow-insensitive.  
- flow-sensitive more conplex.  

## Context Sensitivity  
Take the order of the function invocation into account.  

## Loop Detection 
Implemented using $jump$ instructions.  
Most execution time is spent in loops.  
Buffer overflow tends in occur in loops.  

Compilers use dominance trees to determine natural loops.  

## Reaching Definition Analysis  
Reachable data definitions from this point.  
CFG level.  
Which can reach at the start.  Which can still be alive after.  

## Program Slicing  
Find irrelevant slices and remove them.
