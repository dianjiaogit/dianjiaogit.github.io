### Fundamentals of binary analysis: 
- binary format  
- disassembly  
- code injection  

### Exploitations techniques: 
- stack-based exploitation  
- heap exploitation  

### Vulnerability discovery: 
- binary instrumentaion  
- fuzzing  
- symbolic execution  

<br />

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Binary analysis:
program -> machine code  
security gap  
what high level program does VS what it really does  
  
Focus on Linux binary (ELF) and x86 assembly.  

### Static analysis:
Analysing without running it.  
platform independent  
Less precise. Generally udecidable.   

### Dynamic analysis:
Runs the binary as it executes  
More precise. Access to entire system states  
May miss some code. See particular runs. Not all possible.  

## Challenges in binary analysis:
No symbolic information  
No type information  
No high-level abstraction  
Mixed code and data  
Location dependent data and code  

## Loading and Executing:
Representation in-memory may differ from on-disk representation  
Setting up a new process, virtual address space.  
Maps an interpreter into virtual memory  
Transfer control to interpreter  
In Linux, interpreter is a shared library called *Id-linux*.so  

### Interpretere:
Loads binary into virtual address space.  
Maps required dynamic libraried into virtual address space  
Relocation if required  
- usually lazy-binding  
Transfer control to the entry point

## Compilation:
normal code -> machine code  
  
- preprocessing  
- compilation  
- assembly  
- linking  

GCC does all by default, but any of the steps can be stopped.  

### Compiler:
Input preprocessed source files  
Output Assembly files  
normal code -> assembly  
Optimization  
-S flag to stop after compiler  
Default is AT&T syntax, use -masm=intel to change to Intel syntax  

e.g. gcc -S -masm=Intel example.c
