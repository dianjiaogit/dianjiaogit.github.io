# Compilation

### ISA: RISC VS CISC
- RISC:  
ARM  
Single cycle instructions  
Small number of instructions  

- CISC:
Intel x86  
An instruction can take several clock cycles  
Microcode  
Large number of instructions  

### Assembly x86-64
Side effect flags  
32-bits: arguments in the stack  
64-bits: registers used for arguments then the stack  
eip(32bit)/rip(64bit) program counter/instruction pointer  

### Assembler
Input: Assembly files  
Output Object files(Machine code)/modules  
use -c to generate  
Relocatable  
Position Independent Code  

### Linker
Input: Object files   
Output: Binary code  

## Static Library
Merged into binary executable  
References resolved entirely  

## Dynamic Library 
Shared in memory 
Symbolic references in the final executable, resolved when loaded to memory.  

### Libc
Shared library  
Provide core functionalities to GNU system  

## Symbols
Symbolic names and record which binary code and data correspond to each symbol  

## Disassembly
Translate machine instructions back into assembly  
Has a lot more code  
contains sections  
resolces incomplete code and data reference  

## Tools
GDB (GNU Debugger):  
See inside a program during execution   
GEF:   
exploit dev and reverse-engineering  
Ghidra:  
software analysis tools and features

# ELF Format
	Executable and Linkable Format  

Used for executable files, object files, shared libraries and core dumps.  

## Components:
- Executable headers  
- Program headers (op) - used by linker  
- Sections  
- Section headers (op) - used by linker  

### Executable Header 
Information about the binary  

### Sections and Section Headers  
Depending on the contents  
Not all used during execution  

NULL: a section without entry, name, nor bytes; mark the first section header.  
.init: Run before others execute.  
.fini: Run after program completes.  
.text: Main code; Executable not writable; SHT_PROGBITS: contains user-defined code; Usually point to \_start and \__libc_start_main.  
.rodata: read only data; constant values.  
.data: Default values; Writable.  
.bss: Block started by symbol. Reserve space for uninitialized variables. Writable.
