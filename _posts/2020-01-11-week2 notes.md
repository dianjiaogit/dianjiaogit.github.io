# Information Theory & Kolmogorov Complexity  

## Philosophical Issues  
We need a general & formal & complete & consistent theory for induction & prediction.  

A unique principle for prediction.  
We have Occam's razor.  
Problem: Not a formal/mathematical objective principle.  

## Definitions & Notation  
$i, k, n, t \in \mathbb{N} = \\{ 1, 2, 3,... \\} \\\ \mathbb{B} = \\{0, 1\\} \\\ x, y, z \in \mathbb{B}^* \\\ \omega \in \mathbb{B}^\infty$  
$\epsilon$ is empty string  
$1^n$ the string of $n$ ones  
$\ell (x)$ the length of string $x$  
$xy = x \circ y$ the concatenation of string $x$ with $y$  

Every countable set is $\cong \mathbb{N}$.  
Interpret string with binary.  
Problem: Not unique.
Use bijection between $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{B}^\*$.  
First-order prefix coding $\bar{x} := 1^{\ell (x)}0x.$  
Second-order prefix coding $x\` := \overline{\ell (x)} x$.

$\ell (x) \leq \log (x + 1)$  
$\ell (\bar{x}) \leq 2\log x$  
$\ell (x\`) \leq \log x + 2\log \log x$

String $x$ is prefix of $y :\Leftrightarrow \exists z (\neq \epsilon)$ such that $xz = y$.  
Set $\mathcal{P}$ is prefix-free = no element is prefix of another.

**Theorem 2.1 (Kraft Inequality)**  
For a prefix code $\mathcal{P}$ we have $\sum_{x \in \mathcal{P}}2^{-\ell (x)} \leq 1$.  

Set of $\bar{x}$ is a prefix code.  
Set of $x\`$ is a prefix code.  
Pair string $\langle x, y \rangle = x\`y$.  
$f(x, y) = f(x\`y)$  

## Turing Machines  
**Thesis 2.2 (Turing)**  
Everything that can be reasonably said to be computable by a human using a fixed procedure can also be computed by a Turing machine.  

**Thesis 2.3 (Church)**  
The class of algorithmically computable numerical functions (in the intuitive sense) coincides with the class of partial recursive functions.  

**Assumption 2.4 (Short compiler)**  
Given two natural Turing-equivalent formal systems F1 and F2, then there always exists a single short program on F2 which is capable of interpreting all F1-programs.  

**Definition 2.5 (Prefix TM (pTM))**  
	1. one unidirectional read-only input tape  
	2. one unidirectional write-only input tape  
	3. some bidirectional work tapes, initially filled with zeros  
	4. all tapes are binary  
	5. T halts on input p with output x  
	6. {$p : \exists x: T(p) = x$} forms a prefix code  
	7. $p$ is self-delimiting program  

**Definition 2.6 (Monotone Turing Machine)**
	1\~4  
	5. T outputs/computes a string starting with x on input p  
	6. T may continue operation and need not to halt  
	7. {$p : T(p) = x^\*$} forms a prefix code  
	8. $p$ is minimal program  

**Theorem 2.7 (Universal prefix/monotone Turing machine $U$)**  
which simulates (any) pTM/mTM T_i with input $y\`q$ if fed with input $y\`i\`q$, i.e.  

$$U(y\`i\`q) = T_i(y\`q) \quad \all y,i,q$$  

For $p \neq y\`i\`q, U(p)$ outputs nothing. $y$ is side information.
