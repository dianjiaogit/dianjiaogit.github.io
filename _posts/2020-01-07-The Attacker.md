## **Principle of Humanity**:  
Computer Network Exploitation(CNE) is grounded in human nature.

## * **Life Cycle of an Operation**:
	1. Starting
	2. Targeting
	3. Initial Access
	4. Persistence, Access Expansion, Exfiltration.
	5. Detection

Stage 1: Targeting contains identification of the target network, the attack strategies and tactics necessary to exploit that network.

Stage 2: Initial Access contains of penetrating any defensive security and gaining the ability to run commands or other software on one of the target's computers or network devices.

Stage 3 : Persistence turns initial access into reoccurring access.

Stage 4: Expansion increasing access to a target network.

Stage 5: Exfiltration is the retrieval of wanted data from the target network.

Stage 6: Detection occurs when an operation is exposed to the target.

## **Principle of Access**:  
There is always someone with legitimate access and a means to use it.  

* Four basics types of connectivity:  
	- inbound access  
	- outbound access  
	- both  
	- neither


### Inbound Access:  
Someone from outside the network can connect into the network. e.g. public web, or restricted.  
Access control: "know", "have" and "virtual location".

Attacking method:  
1. Impersonating legitimate access  
"know": Guess or steal password  
"have": Steal hardware tokens or cell phones. Use malware.  
"virtual location": Compromise the network first.  
2. Gaining illegitimate access  
Exploit an exposed software service. e.g. Morris Worm  
Escalating privileges.  

### Outbound Access:
