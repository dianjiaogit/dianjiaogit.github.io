**Principle of Humanity**:  
Computer Network Exploitation(CNE) is grounded in human nature.

* **Life Cycle of an Operation**:
	1. Starting
	2. Targeting
	3. Initial Access
	4. Persistence, Access Expansion, Exfiltration.
	5. Detection

Stage 1: Targeting contains identification of the target network, the attack strategies and tactics necessary to exploit that network.

Stage 2: Initial Access contains of penetrating any defensive security and gaining the ability to run commands or other software on one of the target's computers or network devices.

Stage 3 : Persistence turns initial access into reoccurring access.

Stage 4: Expansion increasing access to a target network.

Stage 5 Exfiltration is the retrieval of wanted data from the target network.

Stage 6: Detection occurs when an operation is exposed to the target.
