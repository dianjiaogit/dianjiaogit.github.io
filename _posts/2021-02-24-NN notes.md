# Neural Networks  
- Computational paradigm based on biological nervous system  

Brain: $10^{10}$ neurons, $10^{4}$ fan in, $10^{14}$ connection strengths  

## NN learning  
NN does not know anything they learnt.  

- Initial random paramters (weights)    
- Small modifications to weights on each presentation of data  
- Simple networks can be set up directly
