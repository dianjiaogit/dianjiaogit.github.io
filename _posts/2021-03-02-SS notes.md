# Basic Binary Analysis in Linux

## Tools  
GNU Binutils tools:  
- c++filt  
- objdump  
- readelf  
- strings  
- nm  
- base64  
- file  
- ldd  
- strace  
- ltrace  
- xxd  
- hexedit  
- dd  

## CTF Walkthrough  

### 1. Identify the payload
base64:    
represent binary in a textual form
using "=" as padding  

Use $base64$ to encode and decode.  
Use $file$ to identify the type of file.  
Use $ldd$ to identify dependencies.   

### 2. Finding the missing shared library  
Use $xxd$ to find ELF header.  
Use $dd$ to extract.  

ELF header is 64 bytes.  

### 3. Extracting the shared library  
Size of the file = Start of section headers + (Number of section headers * Size of section headers)
